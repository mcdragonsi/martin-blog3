      <description>Saturday, October 5th Didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to savour the moment. In the evening we had our certificates and our beers and warm meals and a shower. Up at stupid o&amp;rsquo;clock to get to the Kilimanjaro Int&amp;rsquo;l airport that was about 1.5-2 hours away.
When we got there and when I tried to get into the airport the security guard started to say that my passport was fake. FAKE!! It must have been a bit of travel drowsiness and it being very very early in the morning but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t comprehend what was going on.</description>
