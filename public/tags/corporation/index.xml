      <description>Just as I thought I was loosing yet another battle with a faceless corporation filled with robot drones I received some good news the other week.
The dispute I had with Ryanair about a problem with purchasing tickets from their website.Their website crashed and I was left unsure whether I actually purchased the ticket as I could not confirm the reservation through the Ryanair website using my payment details.
After trying contacting Ryanair through various e-mails that apparently don&amp;rsquo;t work I tried writing to Ryanair&amp;rsquo;s corporate head office in Dublin , Ireland .</description>
