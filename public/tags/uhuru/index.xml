      <description>Thursday, 3 October Elevation: 5,895 m (Uhuru peak), alpine desert
This post was written months after I actually did the climb. There were so many emotions surrounding this day I needed time to process them. So as I procrastinated the post I ended just forgetting about it. Putting it to words and posting it onto this blog was of secondary importance to me. The thoughts and memories will be mine forever.</description>

      <description>Wednesday, 2 October Elevation: 4,703 m (Kibo Hut), alpine desert
Today&amp;rsquo;s hike was supposed to be 5h long to the Marangu route&amp;rsquo;s basecamp at Kibo hut. Somewhere along the 11 kilometres we hiked we left the marshland and entered what could be best described as rocky desert, a lunar landscape that has been plonked down on top of an African mountain.
  This is also where some in the group started to feel the altitude problems.</description>
