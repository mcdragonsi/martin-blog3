      <description>Krvavec
  My recent trip to Slovenia gave me the repeat opportunity to do some skiing again which I was looking forward of doing on the ski resort of Krvavec. I am proud to report no falls or injuries whatsoever.
The place was absolutely packed, probably due to the fact that it was in that weird time between Christmas and New Year and lots of people had the time off work.</description>

      <description>Started off while it was still dark. Plan A was going to ski on Krvavec. No plan B at that time. Just as we left Cerklje there was a suspicious hold-up in the traffic which turned out to be due to the great number of cars - all heading for the same ski resort. My friend and I parked just soon after Cerklje , where the buses usually park.</description>
