      <description>Lake Cerknica
  This is about Lake Cerknica - the largest lake in Slovenia, when its there, of course, part of the Notranjska Regional Park . When its there its about 25 km2, but can reach up to 38 km2. It has a complicated system of communications with the underground reservoirs which means the lake can drain and thus completely disappear. It usually fills up after the autumn rains and the spring thaw, and is empty round May and June (sometimes even in winter) so I was lucky to see it when I was there on June 16th.</description>
