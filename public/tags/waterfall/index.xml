      <description>Fullers Falls - Sgwd y Pannwr
  This hike is worth talking about as it takes you round some spectacular views in the Brecon Beacons.
When I did the hike round Cwm Gwesyn the guide books told us about waterfalls but you saw was actually very small - especially compared to the waterfalls seen on this hike between Ystradfellte and Pontneddfechan.
One of the highlights of the walk is the fact that you can walk under one of the waterfalls names Waterfall of the Snow.</description>

      <description>entrance to the mine
  As the book states this is a walk where you can see lots of nice views and hardly meet anyone. And it was true for me. Only people I met were some farmers on a field, however the fact that I did the walk on a Tuesday afternoon might have had something to do with it.
I was especially surprised to see an actual waterfall, not very big but a waterfall nonetheless.</description>
