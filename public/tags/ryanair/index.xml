      <description>Just as I thought I was loosing yet another battle with a faceless corporation filled with robot drones I received some good news the other week.
The dispute I had with Ryanair about a problem with purchasing tickets from their website.Their website crashed and I was left unsure whether I actually purchased the ticket as I could not confirm the reservation through the Ryanair website using my payment details.
After trying contacting Ryanair through various e-mails that apparently don&amp;rsquo;t work I tried writing to Ryanair&amp;rsquo;s corporate head office in Dublin , Ireland .</description>

      <description>According to my experience, yes. I tell all Ryanair visitors in advance that this here is my personal opinion and will not allow the publication of rude comments from anyone.
I had the misfortune of booking my flight today only to be confronted with an error just at the point you would least like it - after purchase.
A while ago I found a blog post about a session problem with the Ryanair website here.</description>
