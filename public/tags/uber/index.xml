      <description>Bit the bullet and ordered my first Uber ride in November 2014 when I was in London. It went very well but it was for a very short trip.
The second one was in April 2015 and it was from stansted airport to a nearby b&amp;amp;b about 15 minutes away. I loved the fact that you know beforehand who will be picking you up, what the reg number of the car is and where the car is on a map.</description>
