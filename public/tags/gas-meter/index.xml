      <description>This will be my public consumer awareness post. Just for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know me, I have not lived in the UK for many years so I had no real idea how much utilities cost. Sure you can compare prices between different companies but its difficult to know, how much you spend.
However I always thought I was paying a bit to much for gas but was delaying the time to actually call up the gas copmany and ask for some help.</description>
