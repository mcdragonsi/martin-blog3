      <description>I have now managed to send off the container to the manufacturer Aerodyne in Florida . I have just driven back from Swansea where I send off the container through a DHL ServicePoint location in the Parc Tawe Staples shop. Great service, if you ask me, as you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay a high price to have your packed shipped and you also choose what boy its going to be sent in - the price of shipment depends on the size of the box, but with a upper weight limit.</description>

      <description>I saw this somewhere on the internet and found it hilarious. I apologise to any US citizen if he/she is offended but this is really good!
 To The citizens of the United States of America :
In light of your failure to nominate competent candidates for President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective immediately.</description>
