Well, so far I never had any need to publish a blog whatsoever. I created the blogspot just to see what it looks alike and how Google has organized things.
I have done much blogging but sorry to say the Blogspot.com leaves a lot to be desired. Hopefully they will put as much work into this as they did in Google Docs, which by the way is a great tool. It is very simple so don't compare it to OpenOffice or Microsoft Office Excel, but it does some very good basic things and it is accessible everywhere. I put all my skydiving jumps on it and it works like a charm.
