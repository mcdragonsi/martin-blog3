A glorious sunny Saturday on the May Bank holiday weekend.  
This time I started at the southern end at Chase End and worked my way north. Was able to reach Upper Wyche. Still have not reached the goal of doing the whole Malvern Hills up and down (or the other way for that matter).

The hills especially round the southern part of the Malverns were covered in violet, all down to the abundance of bluebells. At one point as I was walking on a path near Hollybush the whole one side of the path was covered with white from wild garlic and the other violet from bluebells.
