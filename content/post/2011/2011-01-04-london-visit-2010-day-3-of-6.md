This was a Saturday and the big part of the day was dedicated to the [John Rutter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rutter)'s Christmas Celebration at the [Royal Albert Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall). This was the second one I have attended and even though the last one I went to was last year it did not feel like a repeat from the previous year. The only difference was to be the [Christmas dinner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_dinner) I signed-up

for that was to be held in the nearby [Imperial College](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London) dining hall. Now this was a BIG disappointment.

Kind of sorry I missed the company Christmas dinner even more. The dinner itself was eat-able but who would want to eat their Christmas dinner you had to get yourself, then eat it on a plastic platter, on a table with no table-cloth in what could only be described as an average student canteen. Awful! Have you heard of the bankrupt Belgian airline [Sabena](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabena) – well this was a Sabena moment meaning Such A Bloody Experience, Never Again. By the way the airline SAS has an unjustifiable connective abbreviation: Same As Sabena.

The morning, I nearly forgot, was spent visiting the spectacular [Houses of Parliament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster). I was so amazed at how much they let you see and where they take you. This was just two days after the student protests/riots when the [House of Commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom) passed the controversial law about tuition fees. The one thing they did not let us do was to sit on the seats in either of the Houses – such a shame as I so wanted to put my legs up
