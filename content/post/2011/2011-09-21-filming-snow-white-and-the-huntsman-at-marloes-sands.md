After seeing the filming of [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_%28film_series%29#Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_.E2.80.93_Part_2_.282011.29) and [Robin Hood](https://mcdowell.si/robin-hood-filmset-freshwater-west-on-june-23rd-1296.html) on the Freshwater West beach, [Third Star](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Star) in Barafundle Bay we have again the film crews back in Pembrokeshire for the filming of [**Snow White and the Huntsman**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Huntsman) on my favourite beach [Marloes Sands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marloes_Sands).

Filming should be around September 26th - 29th and should mainly involve filming of about 80 horses galloping towards a computer generated castle on [Gateholm island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateholm). The film has some amazing actors in it like Kristen Stewart as Snow White and Charlize Theron as Ravenna, the Evil Queen. Other actors include Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins and Eddie Izzard. However the filming at Marloes Sands might not actually include any of these big names :-(

Might have a look at the filming next week to see if they are doing it right ;-)

**Update September 27th 2011**
Drove down to the film set today. Was a bit worried access would be severely restricted but I found out from the National Trust officer that the production company was not granted a licence to close off the beach and was specifically ordered to leave the Marloes Sands beach and the path to it opened to the public at all times.

So that meant the path from the [National Trust](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/) to the beach and the beach itself is accessible. Of course that includes the coastal path which offers very good viewing of the film set, but don't forget to bring your extra strong binoculars and camera lenses.

When I was there they were filming on the NW part of the beach. I had a walk down the SE side but by the time I came back they moved a bit towards us so my friend and I were politely asked to move to the side. A security guard also politely asked me not to take any photos of the actors on the beach as they are a bit sensitive about it. Don't know how some other photos were taken of the filmset. Maybe they have special privileges ;-) At least you can walk right on the set and nobody really minded, we were quite discreet and did not get in the way. The tent at the top of the ramp is used for catering and there were some nice smells coming from there that made us mighty hungry. Should have asked for a snack as by the time we arrived at the Lobster Pot in Marloes and the [Griffin](http://www.griffininndale.co.uk/) in Dale they were both closed for food serving :-(

**Uploaded them manually so they are all there below!**

Here are photos from [Marloes Sands](https://picasaweb.google.com/118260873153557016225/MarloesSands) I took since moving to the area in 2007.
