After all the worries about traveling from [Haverfordwest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haverfordwest) to [Stansted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport) the 5 1/2 hour trip went fine. Blue skies in most of the [Wales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) part, the first snow on the M4 spotted about 6 miles west of the exit for [Slough](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slough).

The roads are gritted and the only delay was on the M4 exit for the [M25](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M25_motorway). It looked like a Smart car caught fire. It was being extinguished on the side of the motorway just as I was passing by.

The worst bit is right here at the b&b near [Great Dunmow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dunmow) - snow stuck to the road and very slippery.

More snow forecast for tomorrow so not sure if my flight for Stansted still on.

**Update 19 December at 10:30**

Freezing cold in Great Dunmow -6C, clear blue skies and no fresh snow - at least not here. There is a fresh snowstorm in [Ljubljana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljubljana) so anything is possible (delay, cancellation, reroute ...). What a coincidence, was having breakfast at the b&b this morning with a lovely couple from [Preston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston) and were actually on the same flight as I. What now, is everyone going to [Slovenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia) (or should I sat maybe NOT going if the weather has its way).

**Update 19 December at 11:50**

OK, we are now designated as late. Estimated departure time 13:00

**Update 20 December in the morning**

OK, after all the snow tears and swear words I'm finally in Ljubljana. Sorry I missed the skydiving film festival though. Off to clear the white stuff from the all so long drive soon.
