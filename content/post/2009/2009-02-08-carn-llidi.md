OK, same book used from the [last walk](https://mcdowell.si/stonehenge-made-in-the-preselis-962.html), but this time it was walk no. 11:  [St David's Head](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Davids_Head) and Carn Llidi. You start off at [Whitesands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitesands) near St David which is convenient as there is lots of parking available - you will be charged parking if you come during the tourist season.


The Carn Lidi hill is a prominent feature in southern [Pembrokeshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire) and you can see it from miles away. In fact I could clearly see it from the [Preseli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preseli_Pembrokeshire) mountains from the a trek I did a couple of weeks ago to Foel Eryr. The walk is straightforward enough but by the time I got to the north-western part of the walk the wind was really really strong. In fact I was a bit tempted to do some skydiving practice by performing some RW (relative work) positions.

As I turned inland and looked towards the summit of Carl Llidi the slovene genes in me were starting to kick-in again and the unexplainable urge to climb on top of stuff was getting the better of me. As I got about mid way to the top I was met by these small thick and very thorny bushes for which I know somebody somewehere knows the latin name of. In my book they are probably something like _Frutex dolens vulgaris_ (the common painful bush). There were some very narrow paths through this bushy thorniness and as I was scrambling up I surprised a few horses that were grazing below the summit. I tried to ignore them but the relation was not reciprocated. The presence of so many horses explained the huge ammount of poo that I was forced to walk around on my way to the top.

The poo tredding and thorny bush evasion was immediately forgotten as I came to the top - the views were just stunning, you could see for miles all around you 360°. I was a bit worried about lightning as there was a storm approaching from the north and as I was standing on the top of the hill I was really sticking-out towards the sky as a sticky thing on a stick on a sticky day.

Getting down the hill, however, proved to be even trickier than the trip up as I nearly got blown over by the gale force winds. I took a different route to avoid the above mentioned _Frutex dolens vulgaris_ only to be met by more of the also above mentioned horse poo and your general bog-standard mud. It seemed like you were walking a path and came to a part where it was so muddy you had to take a detour only to find out the detour is covered in sh*t. So the choice was: wet and muddy shoes or dry and crappy shoes.

Just as I was approaching the Whitesands car-park I was met by these beautiful scenes of a sunset above the ocean facing east south-east. Sorry for the poor quality as I took it with my [Nokia N95](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N95) phone cam. Not happy with it, plan on getting an [iPhone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone) anyway soon :-)
