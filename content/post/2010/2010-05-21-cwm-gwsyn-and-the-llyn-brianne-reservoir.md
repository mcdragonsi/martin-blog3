This is marked as the toughest walk in the [Brecon Becons & South Wales](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brecon-Beacons-South-Wales-Walks/dp/0749562862) book and it turned out to be living up to its name. The most difficult part was trying to not get lost on Bryn Rhudd at the same time as not loosing interest in the walk as well. The views on there are almost desert-like, nothing but dried grass and [boggy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog) moors. Even the sheep are sensible enough not to stray that far from the valleys.

The day of the walk also happened to be the hottest day so far in 2010 and the humidity was excruciating. Despite it still not being a complete sunny day I managed to rack up quite a nasty sunburn and don't forget we are talking about Wales of all places - go figure :-)

This walk also takes you to some very remote areas of Wales and in the 6h 20min it took me to walk it I didn't see a single person until reaching the Glangwesyn farm when I asked for directions.

After the walk I took a drive in my car up through the valleys of the man-made [Llyn Brianne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llyn_Brianne) reservoir that was completed in 1972 so the same young age as I. Some nice views there so definitely recommended!
