Unfortunately my GMail account martin [dot] mcdowell got somehow hacked today and someone (or something) in China sent a spam message to all my 119 e-mail contacts in my address book at 15.35 this afternoon. The IP address the hack originated from was [**115.52.213.93**](http://whois.domaintools.com/115.52.213.93) and is assigned to the Chinese ISP **CNC Group CHINA169**.

It looks like there was a [Google-wide attack](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?fid=3d06568e966df9f0000495be59b0950c&hl=en) as their systems crashed. There are several reports of hacked accounts on Google forums. The message was just a [spam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_spam) and did not contain any viruses or worms in itself.

For what its worth I have reported the matter to the [police](http://www.dyfed-powys.police.uk/en/) and I have also got in touch with the attacker's internet service provider China 169. Unfortunately I have no suggestions, other than change your password regularly, on how anybody else should avoid this specific attack as I am convinced that both my computers are clean, one of them is even a GNU/Linux machine! I take security quite seriously but I do apologize to anyone who received this spam from my e-mail account.

Here is what I saw when I tried to access Google calendar about the time of the attack:

### Update 24 November 2010
The one thing that angered me was that Google has a unusual activity detection system and even though I was on GMail at the time of the attack I saw no warnings. In fact the only warning I received as about 7h later at about 10pm. The original access table said the Chinese access came from a browser, now it says its 'Unknown'.
