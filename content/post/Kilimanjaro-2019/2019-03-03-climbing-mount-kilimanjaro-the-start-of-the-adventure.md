In this case with booking. I heard of a friend using the company [Intrepid Travel](https://www.intrepidtravel.com/) several years ago when she went on a fabulous trip to south America.  
Have been itching to do something myself and a few weeks ago saw in idea about climbing Mt Kilimanjaro. At 5,895 metres its not an easy endeavour, certainly the highest and the longest I have ever hiked. It shouldn't be to technically difficult but it is gruesome. And then there is the altitude. Haven't been that high [skydiving](https://mcdowell.si/category/skydiving).

I have also decided to fundraise but not to stuff it down your throats and make you feel awful for not opening your wallet but more like... You don't have to, but if you want to, you can donate to one of the charities I have chosen:

[DONATE HERE !](https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/MartinKilimanjaro2019)

I lost a very good friend to pancreatic cancer years ago and I have been donating to them little by little every month. 

Vetlife is a great charity that supports welfare of veterinary surgeons and gives them support by phone and email. As a vet myself I am very much aware of the mental health issues in our profession and am supporting Vetlife to further the understanding the stresses in a vet's life.
