Had a great trip to the [Algarve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algarve) recently and rented a [Honda Shadow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Shadow) motorcycle for a week. On one of the last few days of my stay there I planned a trip to the south-western tip of Portugal - Cabo de São Vicente and Sagres. However all did not go well from my start in Albufeira. As I knew I was going to be on the road for at least an hour, perhaps 1.5hours I decided to strap my rucksack to the back of the bike and I used bungees to secure it. As my rucksack as well as other rucksacks have lots of dangling bits I decided to use a waterproof cover to wrap around it and make it more streamlined.

![This is what my Samsung looked like afterwards](https://img.mcdowell.si/2014/11/broken_sgs3-1-e1479767158947.jpg "This is what my Samsung looked like afterwards")

I checked several times during the trip that the luggage was secured. However then I didn't for a while as I was confident everything was fine. Just as I crossed the Portimao bridge I checked again and with my horror only found my bungees where the rest of my rucksack was. I few chosen words were well placed at this point and I was horrified to think what all I had inside: my Samsung Galaxy S3 smart-phone, my Nokia C2, Canon EOS 450D, my spare glasses, contact lens case, wallet, passport, a small pump-spray and an insect lotion. Needless to say there was a few things in it that would a) break and b) get stolen and would be VERY missed. I was able to turn around at the next exit and was surprised to find my bag in the [middle of the opposite lane](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@37.1352461,-8.4598162,3a,75y,292.86h,74.2t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sbw9Tm0V4YwyNird2-99gbw!2e0) just coming out of one of the Lagoa roundabouts, 7.5 km up from where I realized my luggage was missing. I the Portuguese police are reading this I promise I didn't break any land speed records.

Well, the damage was sort of suspected. While I was quickly going through the sorry content of my rucksack a guy pulled up claiming he was (at least) one of the drivers who failed to avoid this unexpected obstacle in the middle of the road. He was driving a Mercedes so I know my bag was driven over at least once.

![This was the state of the Nokia phone. The LCD was out but the phone sort-off still worked](https://img.mcdowell.si/2014/11/broken_nokia-1.jpg "This was the state of the Nokia phone. The LCD was out but the phone sort-off still worked")

Basically the insect lotion exploded and smeared itself equally over the inside of the main compartment. The chemicals in the lotion was apparently not very nice as it somehow discoloured the fabric of the rucksack. Of course the smart-phone was FUBAR. The screen as seen here and not turning on.

I was quite surprised about the Nokia. The screen was cracked and basically unusable but the phone still worked. The problem is that nowadays I call people by selecting them from a list in my phone-book so I don't know any numbers by heart. My surprise cam when I saw my spare glasses. The plastic case they were in was COMPLETELY shattered - it was in lots and lots of tiny bits but the glasses them self were fine. A little smudged - nothing a quick clean didn't fix. The frame was not bent and the lenses were intact. The only thing that was off was that one of the little plastic pads that sit against your nose had fallen off. I just popped it right back on. I am wearing them right now as I am writing this. Well done [Silhouette](http://www.silhouette.com/) for the frames and [Essilor](http://www.essilor.co.uk/) for the lenses :-)
