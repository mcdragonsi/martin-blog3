After staying in a great KOA campsite in Winthrop, Washington, I took the road across the Cascade mountains. The scenery was similar to the [Going to the Sun road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going-to-the-Sun_Road) in Montana. Very stunning mountain scenery, lakes, waterfalls ... it had everything. Unfortunately i didn't see any bears but I was told they are frequently seen on the road.

Stopped for a cup of coffee on the way and took the ferry crossing to Port Townsend. Rubbish campsite where I couldn't even use my pegs to pitch my tent. There was also a storm brewing and my tent would surely be airborne with such poor anchorage. So I decided to go to a hotel for the night.
