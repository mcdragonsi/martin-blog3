What a great experience. Lots of memories and and a moderate skin tan that will disappear quite quickly in this Welsh winter.

Although there were a lot of nice relaxing moments on the beach there were also lots of animal care that we were involved with. The beautiful scenery of the island should not conceal the tremendous work Kathy, Shurlyn and all the people that are involved and help out with the [Carriacou Animal Hospital](http://www.carriacouanimalclinic.com/) (CAH).


[![JustGiving - Sponsor me now!](https://www.justgiving.com/App_Themes/JustGiving/images/badges/badge10.gif)](https://www.justgiving.com/Martin-McDowell)This is why I would like to appeal for your help as the hospital is not government funded and relies only on charitable donations. One of the vets in the UK has opened a Just Giving page here:

All proceeds go to buying supplies for CAH. Alternatively you can also donate to the [Worldwide Veterinary Service](http://www.wvs.org.uk/) (WVS) who organise volunteer work in projects round the world and provide help for various causes.
